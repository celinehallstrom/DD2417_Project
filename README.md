# Create feature vectors - only needed first time
In order to create the feature vectors, you should run the get_features.py file. The features will be outputted to a csv file afterwards. Bear in mind that creating those features is time consuming. 


# Test models 
In order to test how the models performed for the created features, you should run the run_model.py file. After running a classifer a confusion matrix will be outputted as well as a classification accuracy.
